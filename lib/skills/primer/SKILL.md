# Codebase Context Update

Quick workflow to refresh understanding of the codebase via Serena memories.

## Step 0: Read the Hot Cache

Before diving into Serena memories, read the wiki's hot cache — the cheapest, most targeted "what happened last session" signal.

1. `mcp__serena__find_file` for `hot.md` under `wiki/`. If not found, **skip this step silently** — the hot cache is optional session continuity (a project may not have adopted it yet), not a hard requirement. No warning.
2. If present, `Read` `wiki/hot.md` and treat its **Key Recent Facts** and **Active Threads** sections as a first-pass context primer. This does not replace Serena memory reading below — it's a cheap first pass that orients the deeper memory discovery.

## Step 1: Discover & Read Memories

1. `mcp__serena__list_memories` → list all available memories (use `topic` parameter to filter by area, e.g. `topic="api"`)
2. `mcp__serena__read_memory` → read each relevant memory to rebuild context
3. Note any memories that appear stale or reference code that may have changed

**Memory organization uses `/` separators** for topic hierarchies (e.g. `modules/frontend`, `auth/login/logic`). Use topic filtering to efficiently navigate large memory sets.

## Step 2: Explore Codebase as Needed

Use MCP Serena to verify and extend your understanding:
- `mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview` → file/module structure
- `mcp__serena__find_symbol` → locate specific functions, classes, components
- `mcp__serena__search_for_pattern` → find patterns, usages, integrations

Cross-reference what you find against existing memories — if reality has drifted from what's documented, note it for Step 3.

## Step 3: Update Memories

Keep memories current and useful for future conversations:

1. **Edit stale memories**: Use `mcp__serena__edit_memory` with `mode="literal"` for precise text swaps or `mode="regex"` for pattern-based updates. Prefer editing over full rewrites.
2. **Write new memories**: Use `mcp__serena__write_memory` for genuinely new knowledge:
   - Architecture decisions and their rationale
   - Integration patterns between modules
   - Known gotchas, workarounds, and edge cases
   - Naming conventions and project-specific terminology
   - Use `/` in names for topic hierarchy (e.g. `api/auth/jwt-flow`)
3. **Rename disorganized memories**: Use `mcp__serena__rename_memory` to move memories into proper topic hierarchies
4. **Do NOT write memories for**: information already in code comments or docs, temporary state, easily re-derivable facts

See `wiki/guides/mcp-tools.md` for the complete Serena memory reference.

## Step 4: Check the Task Index

`/tackle` no-args mode surveys active tasks by reading `wiki/work/tasks/index.md` — a flat bullet list of active items (`- [TASK-NNN — Title](TASK-NNN-slug.md) — one-line summary · status`), one line per `todo`/`in-progress` task. There is no table to "bootstrap"; do a lightweight consistency check so that survey stays trustworthy.

1. Use `mcp__serena__list_dir` on `wiki/work/tasks/` to list task files (top-level only, not `archive/`). If the directory is empty or has no task files, skip this step.
2. Read `wiki/work/tasks/index.md` (use `Read` — markdown).
3. Consistency check: every active task file (frontmatter `status: todo` or `in-progress`) should have exactly one bullet line in `index.md`, and every bullet in `index.md` should point to a real active task file. If you spot drift (an active task file with no line, a line pointing at a moved/trashed/archived file, or a `done`/`trashed` task still listed), report a one-line warning to the user listing what's off, but do NOT auto-fix — the skill that mutated state without updating the index is the bug.

See `wiki/work/tasks/lifecycle.md` for the active status set and frontmatter schema.
